This project was a partner project about making an application designed to create and order pizzas. The goal of this project was using different kinds of software 
development techniques such as polymorphism, inheritance, and object oriented programming, as well as designing a GUI using JavaFX, to make an application that 
would store orders, allow the client to customize their own pizza, display the accurate price, and switch between stages when necessary.

     * A small Pepperoni Pizza starts out at $8.99. Each subsequent size
     * increase will add $2.00. This means that a medium Pepperoni Pizza will
     * cost $10.99 and a large Pepperoni Pizza will cost $12.99.

     * Any toppings on the Pepperoni Pizza besides pepperoni itself are
     * considered to be additional toppings. Each additional topping costs
     * $1.79.

     * After adding the price for the size of the pizza together with the
     * price for each additional topping, we have the final price.

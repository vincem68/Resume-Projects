**This project is still currently being worked on**

This is a program that will solve a sodoku puzzle. The general plan for this project is to have the user enter in a puzzle, either manually putting the numbers in or uploading a file with a prewritten puzzle and the program solves it and displays it on an HTML file.

**Progress so far**

Solve.js contains the functions that solve the puzzle the user entered in. From testing, it solves most puzzles, only some very tricky puzzles still remain unsolved. Will work to iron this out, and once done will start working on the front end and its functionality.

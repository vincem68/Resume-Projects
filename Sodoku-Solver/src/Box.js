
/**
 * This is a Box class that represents the 9 boxes of a Sodoku grid.
 * The attributes of the Box class are as follows:
 *  
 *  1. numsLeft - an array of numbers that need to be added into the box. The numbers are 0-9 and
 *  only appear in the list once.
 * 
 *  2. adjRow1, adjRow2, adjRow3 - these contain integers that are used as indexes for the relative
 *  rows of the box. For example, the top 3 boxes in the Sodoku grid will have adjRow1 as 0, adjROw2
 *  as 1, and adjRow3 as 2. This makes it easier to look at whole rows to see if a number is already 
 *  in it before inserting it into the box. 
 * 
 *  3. adjColumn1, adjColumn2, adjColumn3 - these contain integers that are used as indexes for the
 *  relative columns for the box. For example, the upper left box will have columns 0, 1, and 2, as     
 *  will the boxes below it since they're all on the left side of the overall grid. This is used for
 *  a Columns 2D array so we can look up whole columns easier to see if a number is already in it
 *  before inserting a number into the box.
 * 
 *  4. next - a reference to the next box in the order. The boxes will be ordered in a linked list from
 *  left to right, top to bottom (like reading a book). So, the upper left box will be first in the list,
 *  the upper middle box 2nd, the upper right third, middle left 4th, etc.
 *
